## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1:** The package `javax.ejb` is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package `jakarta.ejb` for Jakarta EE, which is the new package naming for Java EE technologies.

2. **Issue 2:** The package `javax.inject` is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package `jakarta.inject` for Jakarta EE, which is the new package naming for Java EE technologies.

3. **Issue 3:** The package `javax.persistence` is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package `jakarta.persistence` for Jakarta EE, which is the new package naming for Java EE technologies.

4. **Issue 4:** The package `javax.persistence` is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package `jakarta.persistence` for Jakarta EE, which is the new package naming for Java EE technologies.

5. **Issue 5:** The package `javax.persistence` is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package `jakarta.persistence` for Jakarta EE, which is the new package naming for Java EE technologies.

6. **Issue 6:** The package `javax.persistence` is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package `jakarta.persistence` for Jakarta EE, which is the new package naming for Java EE technologies.

7. **Issue 7:** In Quarkus, the `@PersistenceContext` annotation is not needed to inject a data source. Instead, Quarkus will create the bean automatically just by correctly setting up your datasource. Therefore, the `@Produces` annotation on the `EntityManager` needs to be removed, and the `@Inject` annotation should be used instead.

8. **Issue 8:** Stateless EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped`.
