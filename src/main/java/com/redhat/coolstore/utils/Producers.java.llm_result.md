## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1 and 2:** The Java EE specification has been updated to Eclipse Jakarta EE, which means the package names have changed from `javax` to `jakarta`. This is a breaking change and needs to be addressed. In this case, we need to change the import statements from `javax.enterprise.inject` to `jakarta.enterprise.inject`.

2. **Issue 3:** In Quarkus, CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) beans can be simplified. The `@Produces` annotation is not needed if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier. In this case, the `produceLog` method is not used anywhere else, so we can remove the `@Produces` annotation and use a `@Named` getter method instead. This will make the code simpler and easier to understand.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;
import jakarta.inject.Named;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class Producers {

    Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());

    @Named
    public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {
        return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

In the updated file, we have changed the import statements from `javax.enterprise.inject` to `jakarta.enterprise.inject`. We have also removed the `@Produces` annotation and added the `@Named` annotation to the `produceLog` method. This will make the code simpler and easier to understand.

In the pom.xml file, we need to update the dependencies to use the Jakarta EE dependencies instead of the Java EE dependencies. This can be done by replacing the `javaee-api` dependency with the `jakarta.platform` dependency.

Here is an example of how the pom.xml file should look like:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
            <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>
            <version>8.0.0</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
        <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

This will ensure that the correct Jakarta EE dependencies are used and that the code will work in Quarkus.
